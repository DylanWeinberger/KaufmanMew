					<h2>Slip and Fall Lawyers of NYC</h2>
					<p>The Law Offices of Mark E. Weinberger P.C. has a team of skilled and aggressive slip and fall attorneys who help uphold the legal rights of clients injured in slip and fall accidents. Loss of earnings, medical expenses, pain and suffering due to your slip and fall accident may be eligible for financial compensation.</p>
					<h3>What is a “Slip and Fall?” lawsuit?</h3>
					<p>Slip and fall is a type of personal injury case in which someone slips, trips and falls, and is hurt on another person’s property. These cases normally fall under the broader premises liability category because slip and fall accidents usually happen on premises owned or maintained by someone else, and the landlord or property owner may be held legally responsible.

					Hazardous conditions such as cracked floors, torn carpeting, poor lighting, narrow stairs, or a wet floor can cause someone to slip, trip and fall while inside a building. Other examples of slip and fall accidents include tripping on broken or cracked public sidewalks, or tripping and falling on escalators. Furthermore, a slip and fall case might result from slipping or tripping due to rain, ice, snow or a hidden hazard such as a pothole.</p>
					
					<h3>Proving Slip and Fall Liability</h3>
					<p>There is no exact procedure to determine if a property owner is legally responsible for your slip/trip and fall injuries. The course of a slip/trip and fall injury case depends on the degree of care the property owner exercised to prevent such accidents from occurring, and whether you exercised a reasonable amount of caution yourself.</p>

					<h3>Here are some basic rules to help determine if someone else was at fault for your slip/trip and fall injury:</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>The cause of the accident was a dangerous condition that the property owner created</li>
						<li>The owner knew of the dangerous condition but failed to correct it in a timely manner</li>
						<li>The dangerous condition must present a risk to the person on the property that the person cannot have anticipated under the circumstances.</li>
					</ul>
					<h2>The Importance of an Experienced Slip and Fall Lawyer</h2>
					<p>If you find yourselves the victim of a slip and fall accident on someone else’s property, it is vital for you to hire an experienced slip and fall lawyer. Since slip and fall cases can get very complicated, a top personal injury lawyer can help you by meticulously investigating every detail of your slip and fall accident to identify the liable parties. Upon identifying those responsible, the slip and fall lawyer will aggressively fight for your claim to compensation until you recover all the damage awards you are entitled to.</p>
					<h3>Our personal injury lawyers have an impressive record of winning favorable verdicts and huge slip and fall settlements:</h3>

					Regulations, specifications, inspection requirements, and job safety programs all seek to prevent construction site accidents and promote safety awareness on the part of all parties involved in a construction project.

					<h2>Have You Been Injured Due To Landlord Negligence?</h2>
					<p>Landlord Negligence occurs when landlords or supers neglect their duty in maintaining their property. Landlords who own and manage property have a responsibility to you to maintain the property and prevent any potential injury that could be sustained due to old floors, walls, pipes, appliances etc. It is not uncommon for landlords or supers to neglect this duty and have inadequate security or dangerous living conditions on their premises. Our personal injury lawyers are experienced in dealing with these cases of inadequate security and landlord negligence.</p>
					<h3>What Are Your Tenant Rights in New York?</h3>
					<p>To be held responsible for an injury on the premises, the landlord or property manager must have been negligent in maintaining the property, and that negligence must have caused the injury.</p>
					<h3>What is Considered Landlord Negligence?</h3>
					<p>In order for it an injury to be considered the fault of the premises or its landlord:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>It was the landlord’s responsibility to maintain the portion of premises that caused the accident.</li>
						<li>The landlord failed to take reasonable steps to prevent the accident.</li>
						<li>Fixing the problem (or at least giving adequate warnings) would not have been unreasonably expensive or difficult.</li>
						<li>A serious injury was the probable consequence of not fixing the problem (the accident was foreseeable).</li>
						<li>The landlord’s failure — his negligence — caused the tenant’s accident.</li>
						<li>The tenant was genuinely hurt.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>The insurance company’s attorney’s main goal is to shift responsibility away from their client (the property owner or manager).

					<h2>Negligent Security Lawyers NYC</h2>
					<p>The Law Offices of Mark E. Weinberger P.C. is a personal injury firm whose lawyers help clients who have been injured due to inadequate security. Our firm represents victims who have been assaulted, robbed, shot, killed, stabbed or raped in apartment complexes, hotels, motels, office parks, shopping centers, and parking lots. Whenever a person is victimized by criminal activity, our firm inquires whether negligent security or inadequate security contributed to the victim’s injuries.</p>
					<h3>What is Negligent Security?</h3>
					<p>Injuries due to negligent security can happen anywhere at any time. Negligent security claims are derived from personal injury or property loss and where it is alleged that the safeguards were not appropriate or adequate to protect from injury or loss.</p>
					<p>Negligence cases in regard to inadequate security often have their beginnings in places like:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Parking lots of malls</li>
						<li>Bars and restaurants</li>
						<li>Free standing retailers</li>
						<li>Apartment complexes</li>
						<li>Hotels and motels</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Negligent Landlords and Property Owners Are Accountable for Premise Liability</h3>
					<p>Victims of criminal activity made possible by inadequate security may be emotionally and physically harmed. If you were seriously injured and required hospitalization, you may wonder how you will pay for your medical care.

					<p>There are many types of cases of police brutality and false arrests happening every day. Whatever your situation, our team of personal injury lawyers are experienced New York police brutality and misconduct lawyers that could help you get the justice and compensation you deserve.</p>
					<h3>What is Police Brutality?</h3>
					<p>Some possible examples of police brutality or misconduct involve:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Excessive physical force: There is a line to how much force an officer can use. There are situations that allow police to use force, but they need to know when and how much. There are many cases of NYPD police brutality that cross that line.</li>
						<li>Implied violence: an officer has no right to threaten you with violence. This is a case of mental brutality.</li>
						<li>Sexual assault: This happens in many circumstances and police officers are unfortunately not immune to committing this crime.</li>
						<li>Taser Injuries</li>
						<li>Wrongful Shootings</li>
						<li>High speed police car chases where citizens are injured</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>What is a False Arrest?</h3>
					<p>False arrest occurs when the wrong person is unjustly arrested, charged and imprisoned. This is usually by law enforcement officers who have insufficient evidence or no probable cause to have made the arrest. This can be the result of poor judgement by the police but can also be done on purpose which is malicious prosecution.

					Occasionally, private security firms can also be guilty of false arrest or imprisonment, for instance if they mistakenly detain someone for shoplifting.

					Security guards and retail stores cannot arrest someone on suspicion, but only if the crime has actually been committed. Thus, a shopper could only be arrested by the security guard if he attempts to leave the store without paying for the merchandise.

					Any person could arrest someone suspected of committing a felony, but only if the arresting person believes the other is attempting to flee the scene of crime. A person could not be arrested on suspicion of committing a felony after the fact, unless the arresting person has an arrest warrant.</p>
					<h3>Excessive Force by Police</h3>
					<p>Police are legally supposed to control a situation using the minimum amount of force possible, but instances of police brutality involving bodily injury to civilians or inmates are illegal. If a law officer denies you your constitutional rights or is physically aggressive with you, follow their directions as close as possible. For your own protection, request courtesy and say nothing more. Do your best to remain calm, do not resist as it may be used against you should you file suit. If police officers violate a person’s civil rights, they are breaking the law.</p>
